# Static URL Shortener

[![generate](https://github.com/yegor256/jttu/actions/workflows/generate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yegor256/jttu/actions/workflows/generate.yml)

There are a few URLs in the [`redirects.yml`][YAML] file, which you
can use as such:

`https://jttu.net/yegor256` ([click](https://jttu.net/yegor256))

Here, the `yegor256` is the key in the [YAML], while the browser is
[redirected][redirect] to this URL:

`https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html`

Feel free to add your links.

**JTTU** stands for the "**j**ump **t**o **t**he **U**RL."
