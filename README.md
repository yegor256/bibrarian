# Static URL Shortener

[![generate](https://github.com/yegor256/jttu/actions/workflows/generate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yegor256/jttu/actions/workflows/generate.yml)

There are a few URLs in the `redirects.yml` file, which you
can use as such:

```text
https://jttu.net/yegor256.html
```

This link will be redirected to:

```text
https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html
```

Because this is how it's configured in the `redirects.yml`.
