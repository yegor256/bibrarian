[![generate](https://github.com/yegor256/jttu/actions/workflows/generate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yegor256/jttu/actions/workflows/generate.yml)

There are a few URLs in the `redirects.yml` file, which you
can use as such:

https://jttu.net/yegor256

This link will be redirected to (click it to try):

https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html

Because this is how it's configured in the `redirects.yml`.
